# Hello, I'm Aedín 👋

I’m a recent physics graduate with a passion for computational modeling and coding. During my studies, I developed a deep interest in using programming to solve complex problems, particularly in the realm of biological systems. My final year project involved simulating the wound healing process through a series of mathematical models and code development.

## 👨‍💻 Skills & Technologies
- **Programming Languages**: Python (Proficient)
- **Data Analysis & Visualization**: Experienced in analyzing and visualizing data using Python
- **Problem Solving**: Passionate about breaking down complex problems into their fundamentals and creating solutions

## 🔬 Final Year Project: Modeling the Wound Healing Process
As part of my final year project, I developed a series of three progressively complex mathematical models to simulate the wound healing process in cell culture. The project lasted six months and was a blend of theoretical physics and computational biology. I used Python to:
- Develop and refine the models
- Simulate the biological process and analyse the results
- Visualize the data and interpret the outcomes

This project honed my skills in Python programming, data visualization, and the application of mathematical models to real-world biological systems.

## 🚀 What I'm Currently Learning
- **OpenAI** Using openai platforms to run a transcription programme on podcasts 
- **Interested in exploring**: Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and other programming languages

## 💼 Open to Opportunities
I'm looking for new projects and challenges to grow my coding skills further. Whether you're working on an interesting project or need help with a coding problem, I’m open to contributing and learning from others.

Feel free to reach out if you want to collaborate on projects, have any questions, or just want to chat about physics, coding, or anything in between!
